👋 Hi, I’m Abhinav Pandey (@Abhinav-Pandey-CCI)

🔧 I’m a high school student from India (CBSE Class 12, 2025–26 batch), passionate about:
- Arduino-based electronics projects
- Robotics and hardware tinkering
- Programming (C++, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript)

💡 I’ve been exploring electronics and coding since Class 8, and I love building real-world solutions through DIY projects.

🎥 I also share tutorials and tech content on my YouTube channel (link below).
